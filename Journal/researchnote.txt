Oxford-note:v
2025.10.19/ Katja Fieldmeier: Was Oxford University worth it? : German white woman with shilled left eye for her view complains about culture shock, classism, lack of much money, which leads to refusing social events & work overload as lower-class state schooler. Her parents can't speak English and she had parental issues and struggle to maintain long-term-relationship and succeeded. She started as teen going here and felt like an adult in Oxford. She graduated as law student at St. Catz College. First comment: UK has a very strong class structure. Others: They make a sport of recognizing accents. Bad experience with undergrads but not postgrads. Some Oxford students came from parents who ask went there. Complex English words.; 
2021-03-26: ThisIsMani: Oxford University: the HONEST Pros and Cons: Colleges are verily much an extended family. Con: it's insular and can be bubble-like. Colleges differ. Undergraduate has to do extra effort to talk with other colleges. Oxford bubble because work overload and because everything at Oxford happens in is own timezone be that the  sort of weak numbering system or the workload, the weird traditions, means that you can easily lose touch with the outside world. I very much kind of lost track of current affairs, news that was happening and what my parents and friends in other UK universities were up to. Oxford bubble can be sometimes bit annoying. Those down times after the very short terms, you can then kind of catch up with the world and sort of recover from what can be sometimes very very busy term. They can barely spend time on "outside world" meaning their families, looking London & recent news. No one forces anyone to do Oxford traditions. Nice aesthetics. After months take for granted but looking back, it's "wow". Everything was at walkable distance like clubs. People are welcoming to students in a student-town. Everyone around me looked smarter. The atmosphere supported that syndrome. Imposter-syndrome, which even the tutor says, because with 1000-years-history, that syndrome is inventible here. That tutor did undergrad, masters, PhD here, now he's tutor. Oxford lacks racial and socio-economic standing of diversity. Perception being full of very rich, pompous people and everyone is from the same private schools and same background. Oxford tries minimally to diversify race and class in them. There are efforts to Oxford is trying to get the best talent no matter their background and it's aided by their financial support the offer by contextual flags in admission process to clear obstacles. It's not perfect. It still has largely high percentage of privately educated students, certain economic backgrounds but that shouldn't be a consideration for not applying. There are amazing societies, organizations like... Afro-Caribbean society and networks. Experiences varies from their background, how they get along with certain people and things like that. I never had issue at a Oxford because of race or background. It can vary from person to person. Oxford is not as diverse as other UK universities. Every entitled, pompous person, which I definitely come across them, there are 10 other amazing, fantastic people that are from array of different backgrounds that I am glad I met and called them my friends. Don't let one person dissuade all of us from applying and deny what can be a fantastic experience to a. talented people out there. There's more than being an Oxford-type.
Quite rigid courses. Don't apply to Oxford because it is Oxford. The course structures are very specific. There are some flexible ones, some are very rigid with very few options. If there's one part of course you don't like, it's much better to apply somewhere else. For example applying at computer science. A practical person who doesn't like math but want to be the best programmer ever, Oxford may not be the best place because they take a very theoretical approach to computer science. It's almost like studying an applied maths degree.
Biggest pro in Oxford is the fact that it literally sets you up for almost anything in life after that. Preparation for almost any career. Career = life after Oxford apparently. The intensity, workload, the network. The fact that it looks fantastic on a CV, like there's just no denying it. The confidence that you get from tutorials and speaking to people who you know are experts in their subject and you know no more than you but having a conversation with them and having that sort of flow in dialogue and being able to explain your point of view are skills that will set you up for virtually any industry whatsoever. You might go from law to work in an NGO or from geography to working in an investment bank, the core skills that you get from studying at Oxford from managing to somehow get through 3 or 4 very rigorous years really do set you up for the future. Not only that they support you through your job application process when you're looking for that through the career service and also once you do go to Oxford, you can come back to the career service for the rest of your life and seek support whether that's CV help or interview help or looking for new jobs. Pros by friends, enjoyed it, confidence gained from tutorial system, job opportunities that I've got after it, Oxford traditions that he loved definitely and easily outweigh the cons like workload, imposter syndrome, to sometimes feeling like Oxford lacked diversity. He enjoyed it, despite the cons. It's important to fill census to make the national statistics know you exist so that they and government can cater for you, so that policies and resources allocated with taking the needs and wants into account for the student community. It takes 10 minutes. Using your university address.
1 comment complains about high cost in Oxford.
Another about an European struggling to get financial support and mentioning that he heard the opposite, that Oxford did expensive.;
2020-10-17: Mia Testa: what oxford is REALLY like as a state school student | the downsides of oxford university: 0:32 First gen student from a low-income-household. I was state-school-educated from my entire life.l from pretty bad ones. Average GCSE pass-rate was 36. I'm from one of the worst education authorities in the UK. Culture shock by getting there . Surrounded by rich people. There's no other way to say it. There are normal people, of course, but Oxford has not a good way. I applied to trinity because one of my teachers from school had been there and she said, she enjoyed it, so I was like: Okay. That's good enough for me.
1:51 Traditions: Getting there is weird. You are immediately smacked in the face with a whole lid of weird ceremonies, weird traditions, a lot of Latin. I have never been exposed to Latin in my life but 50% at the university had it.
At the end of first or second week there, you are matriculated which is the Oxford ceremony where you're basically like sworn in as a member of the university and it's just a bunch of you have to dress up in this very silly-looking called sub fast/sub flask. You have to wear that in all ceremonies so your matriculation and your graduation, for exams as an Oxford uniform. It's quite cute with a  little ribbon bow.
2:37 Matriculation was going into the beautiful sheldonian theater in Oxford and standing around while some dons talk Latin and you have no idea what's going on. It isn't translated. You come out and yore a member of the university.
2:53 Dinner culture: Sort of dinner culture was weird. I think every college has a dining hall and dinner is out on every night at trinity at least. A lot of those meals are formals, where you have to wear your gown over any clothes. Funny that people can show in a hoodie and a gown. Proper sit-down, three-course meal, which is crazy. It's really cheap: £4 for formal which is madness and the food is good at trinity. Depends on college. Trin is know for good, cheap food and formals.
3:24 But I never went because the sort of people who go to formals are not the people I was friends with. I felt very alienated by a lot of these situations. You quite often sitting next to somebody you don't know. Quite often they're quite academic and they're talking to you about things that you don't really know about and you just have to politely and pleasantly go along with it and pretend you know what's going on.
3:47 The tutorial system and assumed knowledge: What is quite unique to Oxford is just they very way you're taught. There's a tutorial system in Oxford where most of your lessons are you, another person and your tutor and it's just, you write an essay, you show up with your essay and you discuss your essay. If you're been to a rubbish state school, that is not how you're used to being taught. It's used to be in a class of 30. You don't have to put your hands up to get good grades. Public schools and really good private schools teach you how to speak well publicly, be confident, to engage in meaningful conversation and to convey your ideas convincingly. You don't get that at a failing academy where the school can barely afford to pay the teachers.
4:28 Another thing that annoyed me, and this is a flaw I think probably inherent at most Oxford colleges, is that there's a level of knowledge that is taken for granted and assumes that you have. Not everybody has a background in classics nor Latin. I did very few classics and very few Latin.
But those delusions crop up time and time again.
There's sort of not that space for you to say:"Oh hang on. Can I... I don't know what is going on." Because they live on so quickly because it's just assumed knowledge. She had great helpful teachers/tutors and was so lucky to get them. She did difficult Old English because again it's a lot of verb conjugation and things she doesn't have a language background apart from Spanish GCSE. Her tutors was great at taking the time out to help me get up to speed but when you're in class and things are moving really quickly and conversation is flowing, it's really hard to put your hands up and say: "Hi guys. I don't know what's going on. Can you explain this whole classical notion to me?"
5:44 Tutors, no matter how great they are, can miss that. Not realizing that is the issue but actually, it has very much to do with where you come from, the schools you went to, way you were trained to behave in academic settings.
5:56 Blinkered...ness: I picked up on a sense of being very used to Oxford and forgetting what the real world is like. For instance, during one dinner I said to one of my favorite tutors: You know, this is all very weird for me. This is absolutely nothing like where I come from. The whole dining-hall-experience, dinners, the traditions, everything is very odd to me and he said: Oh yeah, but it's odd for everyone and he's trying to be nice I think. He's trying to make me feel like I wasn't weird for finding it odd or that everybody doesn't fit in here but it's simply not true. When you look at the dining halls of sone of the most prestigious private schools in the UK as Rosie Crawford showed you in her video, son people are designed for this, being molded from a very young age to go to Oxford or Cambridge. It's their norm. At a lot of top private schools, getting in talks from Cambridge is the norm. If you have money, you're more likely to go to dinner parties, knowing which knife and fork or which wine goes with which course. It's just completely taken for granted that people have had that experience and upbringing and so coming talks with Cambridge isn't a big deal fro them. It's not a culture shock. These dinner situations are what they've had at home and the tutorial system is something similar to the education they would have had their whole lives because their class sizes were so small. Similarly, a tutor I had in first year not at my college but at another college for linguistics, we did a language and linguistics module in first year, it's compulsory, told me that it was a level-playing-field now, which is ridiculous. I had raised the point that I feel behind because I don't know anything about language and linguistics nor terminology people are using and she just completely shut me down and said: Well, nobody does. Nobody's done language and linguistics before. Nobody does it at A-level. It's new to everybody. It's a level-playing-field now which is a joke. That is just a joke and so blinkered and untrue. Yes. You've got to Oxford and you are just as worthy of not more worthy of being there. If you've come from a poor background because it's harder to get in so never ever think that you're not worthy to be there and these people. Of course you are. You're more than worthy, but the notion that it's a level-playing-field and that your peers with years and years of privilege are just undone the moment you walk onto campus is so wrong. My point was that people in my class on a very very basic level were using words I didn't understand and they already seemed to be okay with and knew this linguistics terminology and I never ever heard these words. It's very difficult to have a productive class or tutorial when you don't understand half the words your sheet partner or your classmate is saying or the jargon your tutor is throwing at you without pausing for the breath.
8:55 'scouncing' and drinking fame culture at dinners: Gross drinking game culture at Oxford. The posh rich idiots of a certain year group will take over events and be really loud and obnoxious. Throughout your time in Oxford, here's a whole series of formal dinner events that you attend. One of them being halfway hall which is when you're halfway through your degree and the year before my year group at my college, they had got themselves into a lot of trouble at matriculation. They had started chanting at matriculation, which is supposed to be a formal ceremony and they had got "sconcing", another word Oxford term banned at our college. Sconcing is like a drinking game. It's when you go to raise a toast but you say a very specific thing that somebody you know has done. It's basically never have I ever but you're aiming it at one particular person to embarrass them in front of their whole year group. They will get up. They'll stand up. They shout a sconce and then people will jeer and get really drunk and try to embarrass friends, which when it's fun," or them and having no social anxiety, it's a great time but for me, I hated that culture and environment. People would treat college staff with such disrespect. During freshers week you go out for like a hurry or you go out for a meal with college parents so the second years and the first years go out together and the second year is all doing this as sconcing, shouting, making a noise and breaking things in a restaurant, which obviously the owners aren't happy with and they're just saying really horrible personal cringey things about their friends and it's so alienating and intimidating because you're there as an 18 year old listening to this stuff and thinking: Is that going to be me in a year's time? Am I going to be part of this horrible culture? I never did become that because I hate it and I still do.
10:58 Posh cliques: At my college at least, the very posh people and very wealthy ones kept completely to themselves. Their friendship group was entirely white, almost entirely elite private school and at the very very least really good grammar-school-educated. They just didn't mix with anybody else. It's quite shocking. I don't think that was in other colleges. But that's the way it was. Rich, posh people from good schools stick together and didn't really socialize with anybody else apart from when required in a very polite but very distant manner.
11:37 Final thoughts: it ain't all bad: State schoolers shouldn't be put off at going to Oxford despite critics. There are good and bad sides to everything. And to be honest a lot of top universities will have similar issues, it's just not talked about as much because the 'Oxbridge' label is easier to criticize. If poorer schoolers aren't applying, then this culture is never going to change. You will meet nice, clever people there too. Oxford is a beautiful, lovely city. The traditions are weird and fun. You can have a really nice posh dinner on the cheap. You can take your friends. I haven't been to a ball yet, which is shocking. I was supposed to be going to the trinity ball this year but obviously, Covid got it canceled. It should be next year but I doubt that's going to happen. I am excited for coming and dressing up for the ball and feel important for once in my life. You're working with and being directly tutored by the experts in your field and there really is no better education. I watched videos on what it's really like to go to Oxford or you know from a state-school-perspective and people did sugarcoat it, for sure or they just had a better experience than me. I don't know. I went there thinking that it would be a bit tory and a bit alienating and it was but I wouldn't change it. I wouldn't go anywhere else. I did that for myself. I went to one of the worst schools in the country probably but I managed to get myself an Oxford Education. Nobody can take that away from me. That's something I have accomplished. It has both bad and great sides. Sorry for this negative review but I wanted to be real. I am a multi-faced human being.
Comments: 
3y: We'll in all honesty they are looking for people who read on their own and teach themselves things. You might not know everything that's mentioned, but neither will an expensive schooler. Tutor is normal person with finite knowledge, although they're longer. If you know things no one else knows, that would be noticed. To do well instead of just passing, it's what you think that matters not how much you know. So instead of boiling your blood about other people, start reading and thinking.
3y: At the same time you can't lower the level of the education to explain the basics all the time. They should sort there system out, perhaps to have "survival resources" attached to each lecture, so that you can autonomously fill the knowledge gap you feel you need to tackle.
4y: Totally agree with the abhorrent sconce and private school cliche culture! Trinity as a college has by far the worst worst reputation for this kind of behavior. At other colleges l, including mine, our year was well integrated and not at all separated by private/state friendship groups, formals only happened every 3 weeks instead of every night, people weren't waited on or served (we got our own food and put it away ourselves) and we didn't have to wear sub fusc. So, as Mia said, don't freak out!! My advice would be to consider some of the more modern colleges as these generally have reputations for being more inclusive and less archaic. < MiaTesta: Agree. This video is too negative. "obviously only focuses on the downsides" It isn't obvious since few pets and at the end, positive sides were mentioned sand everything having good and bad sides. @willsduh219 < MiaTesta: It's my life's experiences. Not an attack on anyone apart from those who behave disrespectfully and the institution which overlooks poor students, and you should question why you're viewing it so personally. All of my privately-educated friends completely agree with everything I said in this video, and used their common sense that this wasn't even vaguely about them. A joke here and there about 'the rich' and 'tories' is not hate speech. We've seen the culture you deny firsthand. Thank you of reproving my ping clearly. 34 likes < @willsduh219: Double standard. @willsduh219: @MiaTesta and yes I have been to oxford, I am currently studying there! (So he was in Oxford City and then studying outside that city for Oxford or "I am studying".),
4y: @mazzag624: I am privately educated and agree on Oxford's bias that advantages me. I dint had any schooling on how to present myself in interview or how to answer questions like she mentioned in the video, but it doesn't matter. Even if you don't get any extra 'training' like that, being at a private school gives you an inherent confidence to just give an Oxbridge application a go. You don't deal with peopel telling you to ignore this opportunity. There's vast differences between colleges, but year groups. I can absolutely advocate that these cultures exist, having witnessed it first hand. 23 likes, 
4y: @bens148: 7 likes: Her negative personal experiences are coincidently the same that I've heard from many other students. If what you want is sone kind of detailed review of student experience then arrange a student investigation with your JCR: at present, you are not in an epistemically position to disregard Mia's lived experience with these bizarre complaints. ... talk to first-gen/disadvantaged students rather than attacking their perspectives on the Internet.,
4y: 8 likes: @fluffurbia3501: Judging by what I observed personally, it is not always the case that private schools are good at instilling confidence in students or fostering the ability of their students to speak out. Often what happens is that more introverted types are made feel there is something fundamentally wrong with them whilst more extroverted types are lauded. No strategies for improvement are given to quiet students. The result is that initial tendencies become exaggerated as the yeas go by. Loud and bold become louder and bolder while the quiet and different become more. Polarizing experience. < 4y: 3 likes: @MiaTesta: Either way, there's no doubt about the Oxford system isn't designed for introverts.
4y: 2 likes: @fluffurbia3501: Some people prefer writing, which is discouraged in Oxford, which shouldn't be. Moreover, introversion is frequently frowned upon rather strongly in private schools, perhaps to a greater extent than is the case in state schools, at least according to someone who has experience of both types of school. Anyway, whether lost in the crowd in a state school or blotted out by ambitious peers jockeying for position in a private school, it's certainly tough being quiet! < ... < 4y: @fluffurbia3501: Some of the stresses attached to attending a selective private school as a more low-key l student are similar to the stresses as a non-stereotypical student at Oxford. I agree that there's usually less of a need for 'crowd control' in private schools and less likelihood of being bullied for trying too hard. I do think other sites of bullying are rife through, particularly a kind of insidious academic oneupmanship, which is quite wearing if you would prefer a mutually supportive environment. It's true that you likely get some classical literature, Latin and Greek during your school career without formal qualifications. I'm disappointed to hear that classical allusions are being used as a kind of posh secret code by some of your course mates. Maybe you could mug up on some obscure Norse myths and causally follow up with:"All educated knows. So no explanation." If something is worth saying, it's worth saying plainly so everyone in the room can understand.;

2025.10.22/ Kellogg College, University of Oxford: History of Oxford (or "If I were you I wouldn't start from here") : Description: No one in their right mind would recreate the Oxford model. It worked anyway. 0:00 Bologna at 1000s or so was first university in the world of Italy, organized by students themselves. They hire and fire faculties. Oxford nowadays is federal with 34 colleges? Oxford copied very much from model of second university in the world, the courtesy of university of Paris, where this was organized and run by the teaching masters. Right at the start and still there till this day, in Oxford and Cambridge being the only, the final policymaking meeting together in a body called congregation is the teaching masters and the senior administrators of the University.
7:28 In most universities, faculty letters say and can put pressure on the hierarchy but it's the hierarchy of the president whatever body of trustees, you decide policy. In Oxford, any policy proposed by the vice-chancellor can be overturned by congregation and 1-2 have been. It's there in Oxford because it's there in Paris.
7:54 In none of these early institutions is... they're very much in the way of government involvement. There are free enterprise institutions. There's no such thing as an academic career, no salary structure. Basically as a teacher you get paid if students turn up to your lectures and pay fees. It's very much payment by results. Among other things, academics would not approve of.
8:26 One reason why Bologna was rules by students is because bologna was predominant in the teaching of study of law and is students were predominantly lawyers. People who were already in careers. Image of mature, thoughtful individuals in stark contrast to this rookery caricature self-portrait of an Oxford student. This came from a 15th century manuscript in Bosnian library. This was done at that time to depict an Oxford student. By the 15th century, if this guy is going to get a degree even if very unlikely, he's going to spend 5 years to obtain a bachelor's degree. Gold standard is master's degree (DMA). 7 years to study. They are apprentices serving like other young people at that time. Only way to set up in trade by  wing son of a free man or becoming an apprenticeship and achieving the freedom. 6-7 years apprenticeship for most jobs. There's no academic profession. Only a tiny handful stayed on. After masters, stay as Oxford teacher 4-5 years. Then make a career. Almost nobody makes a career within the university. A weave age was very much lower than today. Teachers were leaving at their late 20s presumingly.
12:10 Old Oxford was more open than today. If you can persuade the university's authorities that you have the basic knowledge required the grammar and lodging some to begin, cope Latin of the lectures, then you are pretty much in.
Unsurely, possibly 50% of the student body did not proceed to a degree because of financial struggles. 5-7 years, there was no help here. You've got to find your own finances. Tough now let alone then. Early 21st century people framed it as failures. No institution would survive with 50% failure rates today for very long.
13:19 Back then they thought, it's better to take some courses than not going to at all.
Way of living in Oxford in a much older town than Oxford. Oxford was a well-established, fairly prominent town on Oxford. It was a major center for commerce, industry, administration , law courts. That university grows up from a small and insignificant into this flourishing town. The story of the first 400 years is a shift from that pattern of an university growing up as a minor element in a prosperous, commercial center. There's a shift to an Oxford that becomes an university town that also does marketing. Oxford is known, very very widely ran the world. It is known almost entirely as an university town. It is still an industrial and commercial center that people know it as the university town. The university comes in late, small and it gradually takes over and becomes the dominant partner.
15:24 If you speak to people in the town, then they very often will say something like always well in Oxford till the university arrived and it's downhill ever since. Students don't come here to live in colleges. There are no colleges. The first colleges don't emerge from probably 150 years after the university has been underway so students actually living out in town. Al lot of houses in Oxford are very much older, maybe 500 years older at the back than the front because if people have money to spend, they tend to spend it on the front doing it up where it'll be seen. Tackley's Inn rear, their back, is 500 years older than their front. One of the few Oxford houses being documented. This was typical student accommodation. Maybe 1.300 to 1.500 students. There were 3 or 4 colleges existing by this date but they don't take undergraduates. There are tiny institutions for the support of a president or whatever head if college plus a handful of fellows and maybe 1 or 2 graduate students certainly now under students. The undergrads are all living out in town in establishments like this. So these 1500 students are scattered in little groups of 10 or 12 in a building like this. The pattern is that teaching master will rent this house. He will sublet rooms to students who come and stay with him in that house. He will give them classes. They will pay in fees and so on. This is the basic unit within the university and it's one reason why there was so much trouble in the early days of the university. 1.500 young, energetic, high-spirited, more-or-less-active-controlled, young men wandering the streets of Oxford getting into trouble. All medical town were violent places. Oxford and Ross notorious even by the standards of the age. There were several men running multiple riots.;
