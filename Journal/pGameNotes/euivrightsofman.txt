The New Ideals included religious freedom, education, freedom of speech and political opinion. The monumental work that captured the essence of the enlightenment was Diderot's Encyclopedie, taking 25 years for its completion and in the end totaling a collection of no less than 35 volumes of 1000 pages each describing everything from how to knit a sock to methods of improving the manufacturing of artillery pieces.

Loyola having a soldier background makes its mark on the order, which is organized almost as an army. High priority was given both to educating missionaries but also counselors for European royal courts. This made the Jesuite order very powerful in the politic scene. 1773 the Jesuite order was dissolved by Pope Pius VI due to pressure from Christian countries in the age of enlightenment. 1814 the Jesuite order was reinstituted, however, just as a faint shadow of the powerful order it once had been.""

A team of Dutch archeologists restored the site between 1907 and 1911 and another restoration was finished in 1987. Built with around 2 million cubic feet of volcanic stone Borobudur encloses a small hill and is shaped like a stepped pyramid with three major levels, a square base, a middle level made of five square terraces and an upper level of three circular terraces totalling, in effect, 9 lesser sections as the number 9 is important in Buddhism. The center, rising 115 ft above the base, consists of a large stupa. Each of its three main levels represents a stage on the way to the Bodhisattva ideal of Enlightenment; as a symbol of this journey a visiting pilgrim begins at the eastern stairway and walks clockwise around each of the nine levels before reaching the top, a distance of nearly 3 mi. At the lowest level which is still partly hidden, there are hundreds of reliefs of earthly desires illustrating Kama-Dhatu or The Realm of Feeling, the lowest sphere of the Mahayana Buddhist universe. On the next level a series of reliefs show Rupa-Dhatu or the Realm of Form through the events of the life of the Gautama Buddha and scenes from the Jatakas which were stories from his previous lives. The upper level symbolizes Arupa-Dhatu or the Realm of Formlessness or detachment from the physical world. There is little decoration but lining the terraces are 72 bell shaped stupas, many still housing a statue of the Buddah partially visible through the opened stonework. During the Waisak ceremony which is performed once a year on the full moon thousands of saffron robed Buddhist monks walk in a solemn procession to Borobudur to remember the birth, death and enlightenment of the Buddah."
