It isn't a malwared website itself. I used it regularly. Yes, it has bad reviews about their services: 2025.12.09/https://www.trustpilot.com/review/mamma.com : "This company is a fraud and a scam. I ordered something and has been over four months that there is no shipment and no reply from them. SCAM ALERT!!!!! fake company. Be aware!", "This site scrapes reviews from sitejabber and mixes those in with their own ratings, except you can't create an account because they never send verification email.", "gives fake site reviews", "scam company which gave 0% score to our reputable company without any reason", "Gives reputable companies 1% trust ratings and creates fake reviews.", "they are a horrible fake website to collect deleted expired reviews. and all of their email are fake one as well. Please, anyone knows how to take them down? I have reported them but looks like they are still working." 
yet that doesn't mean that noone shall use this as a commercial resource for digital world news. 
One of your tasks is to ensure what in https://www.blue-shield.at/en/advantages.html says: "
All types of phishing attacks fail

Internet traffic from Malware or other infections is blocked and logged immediately (30 days)

Driveby-Infections from websites are reduced to virtually zero or are subsequently blocked and reportedon

", not companies with bad Reviews itself. https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/phishing : "activity of tricking people into providing personal or financial information by sending emails, texts, etc. that seem to be from companies that the person knows, often in order to steal money from them" 2025.12.09/https://website.informer.com/mamma.com : "3 days ago

Trustworthy", "The registrar of mamma.com is ABOVE.COM PTY LTD. and the name expires on 2032-07-14.", "Owner Emails
mamma.com@privacy.above.com" The company is percieved as scam in the sense of when you buy something and perhaps their services are just that bad or being victim of a hate-storm. I never brought anything there and their book-reviews getting from using mamma.com as search engine looks legit like crediting George Orwell as author of his 1984-book. 2025.12.09/https://www.ipaddress.com/website/mamma.com : "Safety/Trust 

Safe" ; 2025.12.09/https://www.scamadviser.com/check-website/mamma.com : "This website has been identified by Fake Website Buster as a scam." yet 2025.12.09/https://fakewebsitebuster.com/search_gcse/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mamma.com%2Fsearch_results didn't said anything about mamma. Why? 2025.12.09/https://www.mamma.com/about : "Mamma.com, your trusted commercial resource for digital world news. Our content and editorial team are dedicated to providing current, trending, and emerging news on a range of topics, including software applications, air travel, entertainment, television, movies, animation and anime, education, books and literature, and video games." Mamma from Trillion Company even calls against scams at 2025.12.09/https://email.mamma.com/ai-powered-phishing-scams-surge?cid=7227927673 : "Unfortunately, email inboxes have just become more vulnerable. In 2025, cybercriminals are leveraging generative AI to create phishing emails that are nearly undetectable." Maybe the phishing-notice came from https://urlquery.net/report/3846b8b4-6173-4d8f-9677-a25b946fd7ea : lushplants.com.au/ : "Australia's best online plant shop" and registered company at https://www.datanyze.com/companies/lush-plants/362890285 , which also deliever bad quality-products [ https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.lush-farm.com ], yet that doesn't mean it's phishing either. I used mamma.com merely as a search engine, not to buy so can this block be uplifted?
