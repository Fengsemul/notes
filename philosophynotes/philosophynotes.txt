2025.10.27/philarchive.org/archive/SLAHOT : p.3: "Today we 
can portray the dynamics of the 17th and 18th centuries in the form of four basic laws: 
Newton’s three laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation."..."Establishing the foundations of classical physics as we now know it took some hundreds of years. What the early moderns had at their hands was rather different as what we have today. 
Nowadays, when we open a physics textbook, we find a plethora of interconnected concepts: Force, impulse, momentum, energy, heat, power and work, to mention a few.5 There is a scarce number of definitions or laws from which these concepts can be derived from. Different dynamic notions have precise meanings, and they are clearly related to each other.
It would be a momentous task to figure out how exactly our present exposition of classical physics differs from (or agrees with) early modern natural philosophy. This is not my task in 
this article. Here it suffices to say that the list of propositions concerning physical laws in the early modern world was not the exact same list as we have today. There were still some  serious debates between the Cartesians and the Newtonians about how to organize such a list. This ambivalence is also apparent in Hume. It can be explained by his education. It included  the study of Newtonian natural philosophy with the texts of Newton’s disciples John Keill",
p.4:"and David Gregory, as well as Cartesian natural philosophy with Jacques Rohault’s textbook. In addition, Hume studied Boyle’s experimental mechanical philosophy.6 His overall position on LoD—and natural philosophy more broadly conceived—reflects both Cartesian and Newtonian elements."

The terms objectivity and realism are often used interchangeably in everyday discourse, yet they hold distinct meanings in philosophical and critical contexts.


Objectivity refers to the concept of perceiving and representing facts free from personal bias, emotions, or subjective interpretations. It is often discussed within the realm of knowledge and truth-finding processes, emphasizing an impartial standpoint that strives to see things as they are, not as one might wish them to be [Cambridge Dictionary].
Realism, in contrast, is a broader philosophical doctrine which posits that external reality exists independently of human thoughts or perceptions. Philosophical realism argues for the existence of an objective reality that human beings can know and understand [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].


Key Differences
Epistemological Focus: Objectivity primarily concerns methods of inquiry and the attitudinal stance of individuals towards facts, aiming for neutrality. Realism, however, is concerned with the nature of reality itself and the capacity of human knowledge to accurately reflect that reality.
Disciplinary Applications: Objectivity is commonly applied in sciences and journalism where methods and reporting strive to minimize bias [Nature]. Realism spans across various disciplines including art (depicting life accurately), literature (illusory reality in narrative forms), and sciences (the existence of phenomena independent of observation).


Conclusion
While objectivity and realism can interrelate—realism requiring a degree of objective analysis and objectivity often assuming a realist background—their cores diverge in philosophical significance. One deals with an ethical and methodological approach to information (objectivity), while the other tackles the foundational nature of existence and perception (realism).

experiences represent propositions. If any of these arguments succeeded, it would follow that I
am mistaken and experiences are representational events. 
Pendlebury first argues (224-25) that sense experience must represent propositions on the
grounds that otherwise we could not make sense of sensible judgments such as “these sense
experiences support (or: do not support) this belief” and “these sense experiences are consistent
(or: inconsistent) with those beliefs.” If this were a good argument," , "Pendlebury (224) thinks that it is important that philosophers call experiences ‘veridical’
and ‘non-veridical’ and concludes that this means that experiences can be true or false. But
20
experiences cannot be true or false, not really.14
 If calling experiences ‘veridical’ and ‘nonveridical’ means anything, it means that they incline us to believe true propositions or false
propositions. The terminology is misleading insofar as it suggests that there is a single
proposition associated with each experience. " , "Later, Pendlebury (225) concludes that experiences represent propositions from the fact
that “Philosophers of Perception and Epistemologists take for granted . . . . that sense
experiences are the sorts of things which can be accepted and rejected.” This also seems to be a
misleading way of talking. Suppose I watch a magician appear to saw a woman in half. I don’t
want to reject my experience of watching the trick. I may have paid good money to see that
trick. Rather, I want to reject the belief that the experience inclines me to have, the belief that
the magician is actually sawing a woman in half. Experiences incline us to accept beliefs
without thereby representing those beliefs.",

In normal perception in other words, a sense experience is what does the representing, it is not something that is represented. A sense experience, moreover, is not something that is represented. a sense experience, moreover, is not and does not involve a special kind of thing such as a sense datum to which we are related by some mysterious relation of 'having' or 'sensing'. It is, rather, an event which inheres in a perceiver"--"a happening in his sensuous and mental life.

Pendlebury's commonsense realism: https://philpapers.org/rec/PENPAO-6 ; https://megalodon.jp/2024-0624-0548-58/https://www.bu.edu:443/wcp/IntroV5.htm (2000) : "We do however enjoy unproblematic access to sense data. Hence our direct awareness of sense experience is the only genuinely relational awareness that "includes within itself one of its relata." This awareness eliminates the specter of an infinite regress in the process of justification. To this argument one might object that the notion of sense data seems to a hybrid concept that conflates descriptive and explanatory motifs. If we limit ourselves to description of our experience, it seems that we are in fact simply not aware of sense data. We are aware of pained bodily parts and red things but not of pain or red tout court. Michael Pendlebury contends that the development of a sophisticated common sense realism requires an account of how perceptions become perceptual judgments "to the extent that they are imbedded in and engaged with the high level patterns of consciousness and reasoning characteristic of judgments." He rightly points out that whatever may be the relations between concepts in a conceptual system the applicability of concepts must be "anchored" in the nonconceptual aspects of perceptual experience. Human perceptions always blend conceptual and nonconceptual aspects. To the extent that they include conceptual aspects perceptions are raised into what Wilfred Sellars called "the space of reasons" and thus become perceptual judgments. Pendlebury develops a convincing account of how perceptual discriminations both found and merge with conceptual articulations."

p.6:"[A] 'COMMONSENSE REALISM'
The 'commonsense realism' which the Epistemological Realist is concerned to defend
involves a commitment to three general claims:
- we can (and do) have knowledge of the worid,
- the world exists independently of our minds, and
- we have access to the world in perception.
Importantly, these claims are to be taken together rather than separately. On the
realist view under consideration itis held that in perception we have access to the
mind-independent world, this access being a crucial ground of the possibility of
empirical knowledge. To put it in a slightly different way: the world of which we
have knowledge in virtue of our perceptual access to it is mind-independent. Or
again: our knowledge claims bear on the mind-independent world, this possibility
being secured by the perceptual access we have to the latter."

p.7: "What the Epistemological Realist is concerned to show, then, is that we can make
good on our 'commonsense realist' intuition that we can and (In have knowledge of
the mind-independent world. Importantly, however, ER acknowledges that there is
much work to be done in this regard. In particular the I:R theorist argues that the way
'commonsense realism' has traditionally been developed must be abandoned."
> p.8:"On the ER view, at
least partly responsible for this rise in the popularity of anti-realism has heen the
failure of Traditional Realism (TR) to cash out the details of the 'commonsense
realist' intuition in the right ways.
The ER theorist urges that there are at least three areas in which we must take issue
with the Traditional Realist if a 'commonsense realism' about the world is to be
secured:
(a) the TR account of how perception is able to make knowledge of the world
possible,
(b) the TR account of perception itself, and
(c) the TR account of how our knowledge claims bear on reality.
The ER project is centrally concerned to show that once we take issue with (a)-(c)
and replace them with the right kinds of accounts then there is nothing to prevent us
from being 'commonsense realists'." > "argue that
the ER project is made more secure by adopting the account advanced by Michael Pendlebury."
> p.11:"necessary if 'commonsense realism' is to be secured. This will lead us to something of
a dilemma, the solution to which, I will suggest, is to adopt the kind of account
proposed by Pendlebury (see e.g., Pendlebury, 1997, 1998a).
"
p.88: "In 'Defending Commonsense Realism'
Pendlebury outlines a way in which the ER theorist can retain a commitment to the
idea of a fact-proposition truth-making relation while doing justice to the insights
made by Dummett (Pendlebury, 1998b). The first point to note is that the truth of a
great number of our sentences on the ER account will not be verificationtranscendent. (Pendlebury refers to these as 'core sentences'.)
The second is that the
constituents and structures of these sentences occur in and are intimately related to
those sentences whose truth IS verification-transcendent. (Pendlebury refers to these
latter as 'non-core' sentences.) Now itis evident that according to Dummett there can
be no problem with how we could come to grasp the meaning of the group of core
sentences. Put then in light of what has been said above it will also be possible to
give an account of how we could come to grasp the meaning ofthe non-core
84
sentences. As Pendlebury argues, there are two things to which we can appeal in
explaining how a speaker could come to understand the group of non-core sentences:
(i) the speaker's presumed grasp of the meanings of the constituents and
structures of those sentences which also occur in core sentences, and
(ii) the speaker's grasp of the other relevant connections between the
constituents and structures of the non-core sentences and those which occur in core
Sl -ntences.
Pendlebury gives the following example. Consider a sentence the truth of which is
very clearly verification transcendent (from our perspective now at any rate) on the
ER account: 'There will be a large Eucalyptus tree on this spot at the start of the 25th
century' . As Pendlebury points out, we seem to have no problem in understanding
this sentence. The question is how the ER theorist can account for this fact given a
commitment to the idea that sentence-meaning is a matter of truth conditions.
"
pdf-p.90:"To be sure, ER does have something in common
with the TR picture arising from commitments (1)-(3) -like the Traditional Realist,
the Epistemological Realist is committed to the idea that the world upon which our
language bears is the real, mind-independent one. Where ER departs from TR is in
the avoidance of any 'metaphysical fantasy'.
"
p.91:"'Commonsense realism' is a holistic view involving a combination of ontological and
epistemological commitments. Simply stated, it involves a commitment to the
commonsense picture that we can (and do) have knowledge of the mind-independent
world, the possibility of such knowledge being in some sense secured by the access
we have to the world in perception."
